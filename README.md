# Hendry_Rotation_SA
Here is my github for my rotation project in the Hendry lab. I will have documentation for my bioinformatics proejct for acinetobacter. I also intend to have an online lab notebook for the motility project

As of 11/22:

- Acinetobacter 
  - Code (where my short scripts are located)
  - Data (where my data is located)
  - Lab Notebook (where my documentation will be located)

- Motility
  - Lab Notebook (this is a separate lab notebook from the Acinetobacter project but will be the same as my paper copy in the lab)
